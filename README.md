Airship components are UI widgets made for data visualization and available as web components:
* [Documentation](https://carto.com/developers/airship/)
* [API reference](https://carto.com/developers/airship/reference/)
* [An example of a time series widget bound to a Carto-VL layer](https://github.com/CartoDB/airship/blob/40c92ba3b18c69e4ae9b64a6234bd0cc1542b969/packages/components/src/components/as-time-series-widget/cordoba.html)

This example uses [OpenLayers 6.1.1](https://www.github.com/openlayers/openlayers) and its experimental [`WebGLPointsLayer`](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js) to render the map

To run the example, `npm install && npm run start` then navigate to http://localhost:8080.
